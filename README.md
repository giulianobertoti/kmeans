# kmeans

Kmeans project made with @ml5js @p5xjs @d3js_org


Use cases:
 
 - User segmentation:
   - in this case the "x's" can be the purchase amount and the "y's" the number of payment installments.
   - another example would be using product reviews where the "x's" could be products and the "y's" could be ratings given to a particular product.
   - several other possibilities can be used.

Note: the use of kmeans in this software is done by reading JSON, which means that this frontend software can be easily integrated with a backend that, for example, reads csv files, make queries in a database and so on, performs a series of business rules and so on, and returns to the frontend of this repository the JSON in which to apply the kmeans and the view.
